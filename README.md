# StarWarsProject
Project during which I developed a genetic algorithm to predict the trajectory of a satellite.
Where to find things :
  * "IA_génétique.pdf" contains the whole subject.
  * "Rendu" folder contains my last version and report on the algorithm performances.
  * "Versions" folder contains all my previous version so you can check them if you like.
